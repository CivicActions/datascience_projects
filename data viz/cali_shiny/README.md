# California Telework Dashboard

California 
[has built a dashboard](https://telework.govops.ca.gov/track-telework/) 
tracking the number of employees teleworking and the impact this is having on 
the world and the labor force. 

CivicActions has set out to rebuild this dashboard using free and open source 
(FOSS) software and make it easier to automate and scale. The current work-in-
progress dashboard is located here:
